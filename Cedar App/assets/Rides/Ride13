Maverick is the coaster for riders who want one-of-a-kind thrills beyond the big hills. Saddle up and get ready for more twists, turns and airtime than a rodeo. Plus you'll go through a 'twisted horseshoe roll' and 400-foot-long speed launch through a pitch black tunnel. How about that, Pardner!"/>
