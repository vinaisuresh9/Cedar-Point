This world-record breaker is everything you love about wooden coasters, just a lot more of it." duration="2 min, 45 sec" heightreq="48 inches" mapX="0.38742915" mapY="0.14285715" name="Mean Streak" ridetype="Roller Coaster" size="Large" speed="65 mph" video="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPQ4AusAgqU"/>
